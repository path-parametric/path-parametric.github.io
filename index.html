          Path-parametric methods rely on a reference path parameterized by an auxiliary variable, σ. These methods can
          be
          classified based on two key aspects: the system states and the navigation criterion (as indicated by the white
          boxes).
          However, the literature on parametric methods remains fragmented, with existing approaches often presented in
          isolation.
          To unify these methods, we introduce a universal formulation that highlights their underlying connections.
          This
          formulation consists of two main components (shown in the yellow box): (i) a path-parameterization technique
          for
          computing moving frames, and (ii) a spatial projection of the Cartesian system dynamics onto the parametric
          path,
          formulated without imposing prior assumptions on the moving frame.

              We present a unified framework for path-parametric planning and control. This formulation is universal as
              it
              standardizes the entire spectrum of path-parametric techniques -- from traditional path following to more
              recent
              contouring or progress-maximizing Model Predictive Control and Reinforcement Learning -- under a single
              framework. The
              ingredients underlying this universality are twofold: First, we present a compact and efficient technique
              capable of
              computing singularity-free, smooth and differentiable moving frames. Second, we derive a spatial path
              parameterization
              of the Cartesian coordinates for any arbitrary curve without prior assumptions on its parametric speed or
              moving frame,
              and that perfectly interplays with the aforementioned path parameterization method. The combination of
              these two
              ingredients leads to a planning and control framework that unites existing path-parametric techniques in
              literature.

            This paper aims to demonstrate the unified nature of path-parametric planning and control methods. We
            show how these
            approaches are inherently linked by introducing a universal formulation. Central to this formulation are
            two fundamental
            components that underpin all existing works in the literature. These components are: (i) the method of
            path
            parameterization, which assigns a singularity-free and continuous moving frame to a give curve,
            and (ii)
            the
            representation of
            system dynamics relative to this path parameterization, crucial for describing how the system behaves
            along the
            specified path.

            To highlight the appeal, practicality and universality of the presented path-parametric framework in
            designing planning
            and control
            algorithms, our
            analysis is structured into three parts. First, we explore the foundational
            reasons that
            led to the development of path-parametric methods by comparing temporal and spatial references. Second,
            we demonstrate how path parametric methods allow for intricate motions, such as convergence to a path while
            achieving a predefined velocity profile. Third, we show how
            these core ideas extend to
            broader motion
            planning scenarios, where the desired trajectories are intended to fully exploit the available free space.

        <div class="content has-text-justified">
          <p>
            After exploring the fundamental advantages that have propelled the rise of the path-parametric paradigm, we
            shift our
            focus to one of its most notable applications: time-optimal navigation. Progress maximization has emerged as
            a leading approach for minimum-time motion control. Driven by
            advancements in numerical optimization and embedded solvers, progress maximization based prediction-based
            controllers
            have shown very promising results in real-world applications. These controllers
            are built on path-parametric methods, allowing systems to operate near their performance limits and achieve
            behavior
            that closely approximates time-optimality. Additionally, these formulations leverage the capacity to easily
            impose
            collision-free constraints, which would otherwise be non-convex or difficult to enforce without the
            path-parametric
            structure. The combination of these attributes has made progress maximization the
            preferred
            approach for achieving agile performance along a designated reference path. However, while progress
            maximization serves
            as an approximation to time minimization, the precise quantification of the gap between these two methods
            remains
            unresolved. In this study, we aim to shed some light on this question by performing an experimental
            comparison of both
            approaches.

              controller outperforms progress maximization. However, the difference becomes less
              pronounced as the mismatch increases. On the one hand, the minimum-time controller is pushing the system
              to its
              theoretical limit. As the mismatch increases, the gap between the theoretical limit and the real system
              becomes more
              significant, leading to a larger discrepancy between the planned and executed trajectories. On the other
              hand, as

              error,
              regularization and progress maximization, causing the controller to be inherently suboptimal. This
              suboptimality comes
              handy as the discrepancy increases, because its commands are not as aggressive.

        <h2 class="title is-3">Differentiable Parametric Corridors: A continuous spatial representation</h2>
        <div class="content has-text-justified">
          <p>
            As it is apparent in the previous examples, spatial coordinates derived from path-parametric methods
            inherently
            capture the
            concept of advancement along a path while enabling the imposition of spatial bounds as convex constraints in
            the
            orthogonal components of the spatial states. These
            features make
            path-parametric methods a compelling toolset for planning and control algorithms in navigation. For
            instance, in the
            motion planning example of the robotic manipulator, explicitly
            representing the
            admissible region allows the system to efficiently utilize the available space, guiding the end effector
            along the
            reference path. Similarly, in the racing scenario, where minimizing time and maximizing progress were
            compared, an
            explicit representation of the racetrack enabled controllers to fully exploit the road's width for optimal
            performance.These examples highlight the potential of parameterizing a system’s motion using spatial
            coordinates.
            However, they also
            raise a critical question: how can one formulate and compute a spatial representation that effectively
            describes the
            admissible region around an arbitrary reference path as a function of the orthogonal spatial component,
            η?

              <b>Overview of the method</b>: This method computes differentiable, continuous, and parametric corridors
              that are fully compatible with the
              path-parametric framework. By requiring only a parametric path and a point cloud as inputs, it provides a
              system- and
              environment-agnostic solution, significantly expanding the applicability of path-parametric methods to
              real-world
              scenarios beyond well-defined and controlled environments. The approach is built on three key components:
              (1) the use
              of an off-centered ellipse as the corridor's cross-section, (2) the parameterization of the cross-section
              via Chebyshev
              polynomials, and (3) the formulation of the corridor volume maximization problem as a lightweight convex
              optimization
              task, enabling real-time computation.
